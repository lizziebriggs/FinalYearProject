# Final Year Project

For my dissertation in my final year of university, I am exploring the performance difference between object-oriented programming (OOP) and data-oriented design (DOD) to evaluate the use of DOD for game performance optimisation.

This will be carried out by developing a simple game concept in OOP and DOD seperately, and then to profile and use a benchmark testing approach to assess the performance of the two games. Unity was chosen as the platform to carry this out, as with their latest advancements with DOTS, it's possible to test OOP and DOD for game development within the same platform.

I've structured this repository to store the the OOP and DOD projects seperately, so you can check out the [OOP development](https://github.com/lizziebriggs/FinalYearProject/tree/object-oriented) and the [DOD development](https://github.com/lizziebriggs/FinalYearProject/tree/data-oriented)!
